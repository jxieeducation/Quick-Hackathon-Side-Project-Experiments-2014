Big Hack 2014 @ Stanford
This is a decentralized social app.
Decent allows you to post statuses to people around you who are also using decent. 
It uses Bluetooth and/or the local WiFi network (no internet required) to discover and connect to others.

We are betting that this kind of mesh network will one day change the world.
